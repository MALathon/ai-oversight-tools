# AIHSR Risk Reference Tool - Instructions

## Purpose of the Tool

The AIHSR Risk Reference Tool helps IRB reviewers, researchers, and developers quickly identify potential risks of AI models, find recommended mitigation strategies, and guide ethical review using the 3-Phase IRB Review Framework.

## Quick Start Steps

### Step 1: Start with the Study

1. Review the AI study protocol
2. Select the AI use case (what the system is testing)
3. Choose the phase of development (early testing, validation, or clinical use)
   - If not sure, ask the study team

**Tips for Success:**
- Explore the Definitions if terms are unfamiliar
- Explore the Risk-Mitigation-Prompt mapping to understand which risks require which mitigations based on development phase
- The Examples may be useful to get a high-level understanding of Phase-Based Risk Assessment based on Model Type

### Step 2: Spot the Risks

1. Look at the list of known risks for that type of AI
2. Check off any that apply to the study you're reviewing

### Step 3: Review the Regulations and Mitigation Recommendations

1. For each risk, review the relevant regulation and suggested safeguards
2. Use these as a guide to judge whether protections are strong enough

### Step 4: Use the IRB Reviewer Prompts

1. The tool suggests questions you can ask the study team to clarify risks or protections
2. Use these prompts in your review notes or discussions

### Step 5: Record Your Review

Summarize your assessment in your institution's normal review form:
- Type of AI model
- Risks you identified
- Mitigation strategies in place (or still needed)
- Any follow-up questions/concerns
